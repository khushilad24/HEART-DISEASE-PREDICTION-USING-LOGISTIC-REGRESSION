HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-LOGISTIC-REGRESSION
This project implements a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on key patient health indicators. Early detection of heart disease can save lives by enabling timely medical intervention. This machine learning model aims to support such early predictions by analyzing patterns in patient data.

‚ú® Features
‚úÖ Predicts the probability of heart disease based on inputs like:

Age

Gender

Chest pain type

Resting blood pressure

Cholesterol levels

Fasting blood sugar

Resting ECG results

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression (oldpeak)

Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy

Thalassemia status

‚úÖ Built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for analysis and visualization.

‚úÖ Provides model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess prediction quality.

‚úÖ Data visualization for understanding correlations and feature importance.

üìä Dataset
The model is trained and tested on the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.

Dataset includes anonymized patient records collected from clinical data.
