❤️ HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION
“Prevention is better than cure.”
This project uses machine learning to help predict heart disease risk, enabling earlier interventions and potentially saving lives.

🌟 Overview
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. It’s a practical demonstration of how data science and healthcare can come together to make smarter decisions.

📋 Features
✅ Predicts risk of heart disease using patient data
✅ Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
✅ Data visualization to understand correlations and insights
✅ Model evaluation with:

*Accuracy

*Precision

*Recall

*F1-Score

*Confusion Matrix

🗂️ Dataset
Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Contains medical details such as:

*Age

*Gender

*Chest pain type

*Resting blood pressure

*Cholesterol levels

*Fasting blood sugar

*Resting ECG results

*Maximum heart rate

*Exercise-induced angina

*ST depression (oldpeak)

*Slope of peak exercise ST segment

*Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy

*Thalassemia status
