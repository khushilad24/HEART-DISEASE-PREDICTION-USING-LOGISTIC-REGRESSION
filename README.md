# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-LOGISTIC-REGRESSION
This project uses a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical parameters like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The model is trained and evaluated on publicly available datasets to help demonstrate how machine learning can assist in early diagnosis and healthcare analytics.
